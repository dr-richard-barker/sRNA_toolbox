# SRNA_toolbox
This code repository is being developed as part of the new GeneLab small RNAseq pipeline. 
The cloud-based/ browser graphical user interface was shown to be accurate for known smallRNAs, and capable of predicting novel microRNAs and their targets. 
This repository's purpose is to get the sRNA_toolbox to work via the command line to run in a singularity instance to make it more high throughput.
